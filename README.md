## Project 4 - Tacos 4 You

This is my fourth project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. I created a taco finder that will find a taco restaurant that is within 1.25 miles of where you are located that is rated a 4 or higher on Yelp. You will be able to sign in and favorite a taco as well as see what others are favoriting. I used a navigator geolocation feature to get the user's location. I used the Yelp API to find data from restaurants that the user can eventually go to if they are interested.



## User Stories
1. A user should be able to sign up.
2. A user should be able to log in with their email and password.
3. A user should be able to see taco restaurants within 1.25 miles of their location.
4. A user should be able to click more tacos if they do not like the one they receive first.
5. A user should be able to favorite a taco restaurant.
6. A user should go back to go to the Yelp page of the taco restaurant that comes up.
7. A user should be able to delete a favorite restaurant.
8. A user should be able to see what other taco restaurants are favorited.
